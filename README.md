# Identify-Shapes-Using-OpenCV-

<p> In this project shape matching program is being done using OpenCV. At first, I have taken an input image consisting of five different geometrical shapes, then each shape has been identified and proper text has been put up on that particular shape to label it. To identify the shape different colours are used to highlight the particular shape. <p>
<p> The shape matching program is structured by exploiting image segmentation and contour extraction. In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as super-pixels). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics. <p>
